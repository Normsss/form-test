This task took me about 9 hours in total and the most complicated was to make the mask for the phone input since I had to use regular expressions. :grimacing: 

The most tricky part was making the dummy request, as this is a sketch and error will always be expected. :thinking:

I always enjoy doing the layout and styling, but the functionality is always where I learn the most. :nerd_face:

You can find the test [here](), the online demo has been released through GitHub Pages. :+1:
